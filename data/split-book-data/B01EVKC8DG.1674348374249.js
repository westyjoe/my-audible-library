window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Philip K. Dick (1928-1982) was one of the seminal figures of 20th century science fiction. His many stories and novels, which include such classics as <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> and <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>, reflect a deeply personal world view, exploring the fragile, multifarious nature of reality itself and examining those elements that make us - or fail to make us - fully human. He did as much as anyone to demolish the artificial barrier between genre fiction and \"literature,\" and the best of his work has earned a permanent place in American popular culture. </p> <p><i>Adjustment Team</i> is the second installment of a uniform, five-volume edition of The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick. This wide-ranging collection contains 26 stories and novellas from the extraordinarily productive years of 1952 and 1953, along with extensive story notes. Included here are \"The Cookie Lady,\" an account of a young boy whose relationship with a lonely widow results in a bizarre act of transformation, <i>Second Variety</i> (filmed in 1995 as <i>Screamers</i>), a novella that powerfully evokes a post-apocalyptic society overrun by all-too-human looking robots known as \"Claws,\" and the title story, in which a small accident of timing leads real estate salesman Ed Fletcher to an unexpected confrontation with the malleable nature of a once familiar world. Like its predecessor, <i>The King of the Elves</i>, this new volume offers both an astonishing variety of narrative pleasures and a fascinating glimpse into the evolution of a major American artist. </p>";
