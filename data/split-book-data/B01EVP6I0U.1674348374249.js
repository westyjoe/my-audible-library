window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Dick skillfully explores the psychological ramifications of this nightmare.\" - <i>The New York Times Review of Books</i> </p> <p><i>Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said</i> grapples with many of the themes Philip K. Dick is best known for - identity, altered reality, drug use, and dystopia - in a rollicking chase story that earned the novel the John W. Campbell Award and nominations for the Hugo and Nebula. </p> <p>Jason Taverner - world-famous talk show host and man-about-town - wakes up one day to find that no one knows who he is - including the vast databases of the totalitarian government. And in a society where lack of identification is a crime, Taverner has no choice but to go on the run with a host of shady characters, including crooked cops and dealers of alien drugs. But do they know more than they are letting on? And just how can a person's identity be erased overnight? </p>";
