window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ragle Gumm has a unique job: Every day he wins a newspaper contest. And when he isn’t consulting his charts and tables, he enjoys his life in a small town, in 1959. At least, that’s what he thinks. But then strange things start happening. He finds a phone book where all the numbers have been disconnected, and a magazine article about a famous starlet named Marilyn Monroe, whom he’s never heard of. Plus, everyday objects are beginning to disappear and are replaced by strips of paper with words written on them, like \"bowl of flowers\" and \"soft-drink stand\". When Ragle skips town to try to find the cause of these bizarre occurrences, his discovery could make him question everything he has ever known.</p>";
