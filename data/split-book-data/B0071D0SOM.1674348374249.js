window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ray Bradbury’s novel Fahrenheit 451 is an enduring masterwork of 20th-century American literature - a chilling vision of a dystopian future built on the foundations of ignorance, censorship, and brutal repression. The origins and evolution of Bradbury’s darkly magnificent tale are explored in <i>A Pleasure to Burn</i>, a collection of 16 selected shorter works that prefigure the grand master’s landmark novel. With classic, thematically interrelated stories alongside many crucial lesser-known ones - including, at the collection’s heart, the novellas “Long after Midnight” and “The Fireman” - <i>A Pleasure to Burn</i> is an indispensable companion to the most powerful work of America’s preeminent storyteller and a wondrous confirmation of the inimitable Bradbury’s brilliance, magic, and fire. </p> <p>Ray Bradbury, one of the most popular science fiction writers in the world, is the author of more than five hundred short stories, novels, plays, and poems. He has won many awards, including the National Book Award and the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. </p>";
