window.bookSummaryJSON = "Viewed by many as the greatest science fiction writer on any planet, Philip K. Dick has written some of the most intriguing, original, and thought-provoking fiction of our time. This collection includes stories that will make you laugh, cringe...and stop and think. <p> In \"The Minority Report,\" a special unit that employs those with the power of precognition to prevent crimes proves itself less than reliable. This story was the basis of the feature film <i>Minority Report</i>.</p> <p> In, \"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,\" an everyguy's yearning for more exciting \"memories\" places him in a danger he never could have imagined. This story was the basis of the feature film <i>Total Recall</i>.</p> <p> In \"Paycheck,\" a mechanic who has no memory of the previous two years of his life finds that a bag of seemingly worthless and unrelated objects can actually unlock the secret of his recent past, and insure that he has a future. This story was the basis of the feature film <i>Paycheck</i>.</p> <p> In \"Second Variety,\" the UN's technological advances to win a global war veer out of control, threatening to destroy all of humankind. This story was the basis of the feature film <i>Screamers</i>.</p> <p> And \"The Eyes Have It\" is a whimsical, laugh-out-loud play on the words of the title.</p>";
