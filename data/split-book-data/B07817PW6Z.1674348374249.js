window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Stories Behind the Series</b> </p> <p>Though perhaps most famous as a novelist, Philip K. Dick wrote more than 100 short stories over the course of his career, each as mind-bending and genre-defining as his longer works. <i>Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams</i> collects 10 of the best. In \"Autofac,\" Dick shows us one of the earliest examples (and warnings) in science fiction of self-replicating machines. \"Exhibit Piece\" and \"The Commuter\" feature Dick exploring one of his favorite themes: the shifting nature of reality and whether it is even possible to perceive the world as it truly exists. And \"The Hanging Stranger\" provides a thrilling, dark political allegory as relevant today as it was when Dick wrote it at the height of the Cold War. </p> <p>Strange, funny, and powerful, the stories in this collection highlight a master at work, encapsulating his boundless imagination and deep understanding of the human condition. </p>";
