Tolkien’s epic adventure </b><b><i>The Lord of the Rings</i></b><b>, is read by the BAFTA award-winning actor, director, and author Andy Serkis. </b></p> <p>The company of the Ring is torn asunder. Frodo and Sam continue their journey alone down the great River Anduin - alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go. This continues the classic tale begun in <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, which reaches its awesome climax in <i>The Return of the King</i>.</p>";
